neuron_trace.py 
2 filters: 
hard cap at 100,000 pixels - anything under is removed - need to test on more examples to fine tune this threshold 
Filtering based on geodesic distance of tubulin from DAPI stain. 
- Furthest point of tubulin needs to be 4x the radius of the nucleus - again works so far but need to test on more examples. 
- also need to remove the shit skeleton tool 

measure_axon.py
Need to test the axon measurment tool - works thus far but I fear it may break in extreme cases of microtubule disorganisation 
Perhaps have a system to fall back on - taking the medial geodesic for extreme cases ??

nucleus_detector.py 
Only one example where this fails. Mistaking multi 

TO DO 
- not cry 
- touch grass
THEN 
- Produce batch version and pass over all exisiting datasets and evaluate performance - measure against human labels and plot differences for PAVNCD1_1-5-_8bit_panel

HOW TF AM I GONNA DO MDI QUANTIFICATION ?!?!?!!!?!!?!?!?
